# My-father-Bussiness-analysis-and-forecasting-retail-liquor-business---Data-Analysis
This project is based on a real business scenario inspired by my father’s retail liquor business, Teja Wines, operating multiple branches in Prakasam district, Andhra Pradesh. The goal of this project is to analyze sales patterns, customer behavior, and future trends to support data-driven business decisions.
